Welcome to the GitHub page of the ViSCa code: a toolbox for performing Vibrational Spectroscopy Calculations. Like the golden bough (golden like a mistletoe; "viscum") that showed Aeneis where to find the entrance to the underworld where he would obtain words of wisdom from his father residing in the Elysian fields (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Bough_(mythology), and at the bottom of this readme file), we hope that the ViSCa tools on this page may help scientists interpret their vibrational spectroscopy datasets. 



Currently users can download the following tools:

Vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy:

1. Code to calculate the orientation-dependency of the VSFG response to the protein orientation of a given protein structure (in PDB format). Spectral match in the amide-I region w.r.t. experimental data can be visualized in a so-called 2D-RSS plot (see ), and at the best-matching grid point in orientaion space, fits can be performed to finetune the spectral parameters and thus the match.

2. The frame-selection method (see ) that allowsshe electhe selection of frames from a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, based on the spectral match in the amide-I region.


2DIR:

3. 2DIR spectra calculation based on PDB input files

4. 2DIR spectra calculation and frame-selection method for MD frames (work in progress)


Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD):

5. Clean-up of the code is in progress; will upload final code soon.

Sum-freqency scattering (SFS):

6. Code to calculate sum-freqency scattering spectra in the amide-I region; will upload soon.



Further details about the code's name

As Virgil wrote between 29 and 19 BC, in his epic Aeneid (book VI):
tollunt se celeres liquidumque per aera lapsae
sedibus optatis gemina super arbore sidunt,
discolor unde auri per ramos aura refulsit.
quale solet siluis brumali frigore **uiscum**
fronde uirere noua, quod non sua seminat arbos,
et croceo fetu teretis circumdare truncos,
talis erat species auri frondentis opaca
ilice, sic leni crepitabat brattea uento.

Translation into English:
(So speaking, he checked his steps, marking what signs they bring, where they direct their course. As eyes could keep them within sight; then, when they came to the jaws of noisome Avernus,) 
they swiftly rise and, dropping through the unclouded air, perch side by side on their chosen goal – a tree, through whose branches flashed the contrasting glimmer of gold. As in winter’s cold, amid the woods, the mistletoe, sown of an alien tree, is wont to bloom with strange leafage, and with yellow fruit embrace the shapely stems: such was the vision of the leafy gold on the shadowy ilex, so rustled the foil in the gentle breeze.
