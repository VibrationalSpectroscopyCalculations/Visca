orient_scattering_plotter method:
This method is identical to "orient_plotter", but uses the local field correction factors based on Rayleigh-Gans-Debye theory. See https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c02870 for more details on these factors. The input file requires a few additional lines: visible incidence angle in degrees (theta1_vis), IR incidence angle in degrees (theta1_ir), particle radius in nm (R), scattering angle in degrees (scat_angle), opening angle between vis and IR in degrees (beta) and angle between IR and forward k vector of SF in degrees (alpha). Note - this method currently only works for the achiral polarisation combinations (PPP, SSP, SPS and PSS).
