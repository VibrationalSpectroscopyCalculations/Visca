orient_plotter method:
This method uses the ViSCa frequency mapping SFG model. It is part of the ViSCa orientation analysis.
The plotter can run without first running ViSCa orient. It calculates and plot a single set SFG spectra of an orientation with theta and psi angles specified in the commandline.
It also calculates the residual sum square (RSS) deviation between the calculated spectra and the experimental spectra specified in the input file.
The RSS values are normalized to the number of experimental spectral points in the specfied spectral region.
example of usage:
$ visca orient_plotter input.inp 90 45
above command plots the calculated SFG spectra from orientation theta=90 degrees and psi=45 degreesrelative to the .pdb structure specified in the input file "input.inp".
