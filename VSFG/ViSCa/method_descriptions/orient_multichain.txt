orient multichain method:
This is a custom version of ViSCa orient that supports multiple protein chains.
The script assumes that you have N.pdb files in the pdb location specified in the input file. 
The pdb files needs to each contain one protein chain and be name "1.pdb", "2.pdb", "3.pdb" and so on.
Note: Vibrational coupling between protein chains are not included, but the interference is coherently summed.
