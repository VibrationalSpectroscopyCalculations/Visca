orient_visualize_ensemble method:
This method is part of the ViSCa orientational analysis. The "orient_visualize_enesemble" method uses the ensemble (.dat) file generated by the "orient_RSS_cutoff" method (stored in the "results" folder). 
The "visualize_ensemble" method visualizes the protein structures in the best matching ensemble with VMD.
Warning the first frame shown in VMD is the input pdb file. The following visualized frames are the best matching ensemble structures.
