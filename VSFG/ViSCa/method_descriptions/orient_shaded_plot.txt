orient_shaded_plot method:
This method is part of the ViSCa orientational analysis. The shaded_plot uses the RSS values generated by ViSCa orient.
It calculates and plots the all SFG spectra that corresponds to RSS values below the threshold specified in the input file.
The thick line corresponds to the spectrum with the lowest RSS deviation and the shaded area marks the area covered by all the spectra from the best matching ensemble with RSS below the RSS threshold.
