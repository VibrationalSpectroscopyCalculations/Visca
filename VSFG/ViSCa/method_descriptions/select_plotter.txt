select_plotter method:
This method uses the ViSCa frequency mapping SFG model. It is part of the ViSCa frame selection.
The plotter can run without first running ViSCa select. It calculates and plot a single set SFG spectra. from frames specified in the commandline.
It also calculates the residual sum square (RSS) deviation between the calculated spectra and the experimental spectra specified in the input file.
The RSS values are normalized to the number of experimental spectral points in the specfied spectral region.
example of usage:
$ visca select_plotter input.inp 1 5
above command plots the calculated SFG spectra from frame 1-5 in the .dcd file specified in input file "input.inp". Frames are combined in the fortran script such that the average C=O bondlength is used.
