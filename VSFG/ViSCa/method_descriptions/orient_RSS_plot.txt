RSS_orient_plot method:
This method is part of the ViSCa orientational analysis. The RSS_orient_plot method uses the RSS values generated by ViSCa orient. 
The method plots the RSS values as a 2D contour plot as a function of rotational angles psi and theta (phi is left out as it corresponds to the azimuthal angle and the SFG equations already assumes azimuthal symmetry).
