orient_RSS_cutoff method:
This method is part of the ViSCa orientational analysis. The "orient_RSS_cutoff" method uses the RSS values generated by ViSCa orient. 
The method iteratively adds calculated spectra corresponding to the lowest RSS values and calculates the standard deviation between the best matching spectra. The calculation ends when the deviation is higher than the experimental standard deviation (exp_std) specified in the input file.
This method is meant to help users find and appropriate RSS threshold based on the experimental standard deviation.
