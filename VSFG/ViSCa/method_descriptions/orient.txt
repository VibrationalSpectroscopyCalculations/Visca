orient method:
This method uses the ViSCa frequency mapping SFG model. It is the fundamental method of the ViSCa orientation analysis.
The method uses VMD to orient the specified protein structure (.pdb) in all possible orientation with a specified resolution.
The method calculates a list of the residual sum square (RSS) deviations between a specified experimental SFG spectra and calculated SFG spectra for each oriented protein structure.
The RSS values are normalized to the number of experimental spectral points in the specfied spectral region.
