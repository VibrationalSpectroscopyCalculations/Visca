Replace the Makefile in the ViSCa/ directory with the one from this directory (Stops fortran compilation).  
Copy the "visca.out" file from this directory to the ViSCa/ directory. (Adds the precompiled visca script).  

Be wary: ViSCa is not supported and tested on Mac. It is left to the user to validate the results.
